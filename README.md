# Description

This repository describes a simple image from [debian:12.5](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/) with added tools.

The purpose is to have a base image with docker, docker-compose and some tools (make, curl)

Tags fix the project in the current version, but this repository may evolve as ZOL's wishes
